# ðŸ§¹ AI-Powered Data Cleaning Agent

An intelligent data preprocessing tool that uses both **rule-based methods** and **AI (OpenAI GPT)** to clean and transform raw data. This project is a stepping stone toward building a full **automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline**, including feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Upload and clean datasets from:
  - CSV/Excel files
  - APIs
  - SQL databases
- âœ… Cleans data using:
  - Rule-based techniques (handling missing values, data types, duplicates)
  - AI-based contextual cleaning via OpenAI's GPT
- âœ… Outputs cleaned data in structured JSON format
- âœ… Built with FastAPI and LangGraph (LangChain)
